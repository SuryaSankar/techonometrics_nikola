A little background about me - I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, but have worked as a software engineer for my entire career. I have co-founded an online printing ecommerce startup and have seen some ups and downs in the business. I am not sure if it qualifies me to advise others on what works. But I do think I have a first hand experience of things that don't work and sharing them might help others avoid some pitfalls. Besides, I have a huge interest in technology as well as economics and in their complex interplay. This site will be an attempt to record some of my thoughts on these subjects.
