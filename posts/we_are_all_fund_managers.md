The goal of this post is to understand how startup funding works. Not from a mechanistic point of view - there are lot of articles which can tell you the practical approach to raising fund. The following is going to be more of a very high level philosophical perspective of the nature of startup funding. If we can get a birds eye view of the whole landscape, we can then attempt to make an informed decision on whether raising funds will work for our business

A basic primer of how startup funding works
============================================

The entrepreneur sets up a venture and reaches out for external funds. The funds are seeked mostly after building a small working version of the model with a few customers. But if the entrepreneur is experienced or if the idea is very revolutionary, he/she might even be able to raise funds with just an idea itself. The first set of investors who invest in this business do so in their personal capacities mostly - meaning the funds invested are out of their earnings. Some family owned funds also invest in this stage. Either way it is clear that the investors have a personal stake in this stage and would press for good returns.

Now how can they expect returns? It is like investing in shares of a public company. Sometimes you might make money when the company pays dividends out of its profits. (This almost never happens in the startup world.) But you are more likely to make money by selling the shares to someone else. If you can sell the shares for more than what you paid for them, you make profit. If you sell it for less, you make a loss. Of course buy low and sell high is the basic idea behind any investment. But it is important to reiterate this because it is often forgotten that this is the same logic followed by startup investors as well. So when it seems incomprehensible that some startups continue to raise funds even after not showing any profit for several years, one just needs to understand that the investors are still continuing to believe that they can sell their shares higher than what they bought them for. That's the only thing that matters.

So that brings us to the next question. Why do the investors believe that someone else will pay more for their shares? 

For that matter, valuation of any asset is done in a similar manner. The value of any investment is in the minds of the investors - based on how much they think they can later sell it for. This is also known as the Greater Fool theory.
Why do you buy gold on any given day? Because you believe that you can sell it at a later date for a higher price. And gold market has mostly justified that belief. 

When the particular security being invested is traded in a public market - the price usually remains stable. The reason lies in wisdom of the crowds. If there is some information in the publicly released documents - investors are likely to take advantage of it. Since the opportunity for arbitrage is widely available, the prices will reach an equilibrum level quickly.

But in the private markets - since the number of investors is low - it is hard to gain insights from the behavior of other investors. So, this means that the valuation of the startup share could differ very drastically from the value it will eventually fetch when it hits the public market

Latter stage investors usually have terms better than earlier stage investors
==============================================================================

This is also a fairly common phenomenon. The anti-dilution clauses, the liquidation preference clauses will all combine to make sure that the latter stage investors have a better downside protection. This is inevitable. As the company keeps growing, it should either try to reach profitability or it should reach out for more funds. Most early stage investors used to encourage the entrepreneurs 


Continuous investments into unprofitable companies can mask management failures
================================================================================

A lot of money can keep getting pumped into unprofitable businesses on account of their growth potential. A lot of the expenditures are justified as capital expenditures. But in the case where the capital investment is not directly priced it is not quite clear. For example, if you are building a lab to research and develop an invisible jacket, with the eventual monetization model being the sale of the jackets - then at least there is a clear metric on whether the capital investment was worth it or not. But
